1. Primitive Data types in java are
     :-int,double,float,boolean,short,long,char,byte
2. Identifiers in java are characters .
   which are class ,variable,method,package, interface.
3. final class is a class which is declared with the finl keyword.
4  The 1st method is by using the 'final' keyword
   like 
    final public class FinalClass {

    } 
   the 2nd method is by making all constructors private
   like
   public class FinalClass {
   -------
     private FinalClass() {

     }
   }

5. yes we can create an instance of final class in another class.
6. The volatile keyword prevents the compiler from performing optimization on code involving volatile objects, thus ensuring that each volatile variable assignment and read has a
   corresponding memory access.
7. use of tangent keyword is used to return the trigonometric tangent of an angle. 
8. In Java there are two types of casting 
   : Widening Casting
   : Narrowing Casting
9. Placing a primitive variable in an object is known as boxing. This allows the primitive to be used where objects are required.
   For this purpose Java provides wrapper classes for each primitive variable.
   Converting an object of a wrapper type (Integer) to its corresponding primitive (int) value is called unboxing. The Java compiler applies unboxing when an object of a wrapper class is
   : Passed as a parameter to a method that expects a value of the corresponding primitive type.
10. Keywords are the reserved words that have a pre defined meaning for the compiler and hence are restricted to be used as identifiers.

    Identifiers are the name assigned to different programming constructs like classes, interfaces, methods , variables etc.

    Literals are the values that are assigned to Identifiers.
